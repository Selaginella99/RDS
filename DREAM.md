Dialogue on Reverse Engineering Assessment and Methods [(DREAM)](http://dreamchallenges.org/) shares a vision allowing individuals and groups to collaborate openly so that the 
**“wisdom of the crowd”** provides the greatest impact on science and human health. This is similiar to DSC project.

[Wisdom of crowds for robust gene network inference](http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v9/n8/full/nmeth.2016.html) characterized **the performance, data requirements and inherent biases of different inference approaches**, 
and also provided **guidelines for algorithm application and development**, and established **community-based methods** as established a powerful and robust tool for the inference of transcriptional gene regulatory networks.
>They observed that no single inference method performs optimally across all data sets. In contrast, *integration of predictions from multiple inference methods* showed robust and high performance across diverse data sets.

[Principles and methods of integrative genomic analyses in cancer](http://www.nature.com/nrc/journal/v14/n5/full/nrc3721.html) summarized the objectives, methods and computational tools of integrative genomics that are available to date, as is their implementation in (breast) cancer research.

Epigenome Roadmap's [Thread articles](http://www.nature.com/collections/vbqgtr/) included "Integrative analysis of 111 reference human epigenomes", "Large-scale imputation of epigenomic datasets for systematic annotation of diverse human tissues" and "Opportunities for drug repositioning from phenome-wide association studies" etc.
