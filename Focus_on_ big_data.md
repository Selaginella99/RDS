## Focus on big data series

Nature Neuroscience presents a special focus issue highlighting big data efforts on its issue:

**how credit may be given for data sharing**:

>The first is the launch of 'data papers' or full 'data journals', that is, journals that are designed to describe a data set rather than an analysis of data. 
Data papers are designed to serve two purposes...to co-opt our current **paper-based reward system** to credit researchers who make data available. 
 

>The second approach is the creation of a citation and tracking system for data sets themselves, independent of whether a data paper appears.

researchers can gain credit for data, research communities...the relative value...academic promotions, funding and careers.
